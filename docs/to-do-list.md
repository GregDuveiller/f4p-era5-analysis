# To-do-list
+ make a map of sensitivities at pixel level (or aggregating some together) of the diff in LAI vs diff in LST
+ generalize the fucntions to extract data
+ get a month-pixel temperature threshold to isolate places where there is no snow (and in which there is a growing season)
+ arrange a view by panels (for each climzone) in which we show delta_LAI vs other vars
