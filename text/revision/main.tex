\begin{abstract}

Atmospheric reanalyses combine observations and models through data assimilation techniques to 
provide 
spatio-temporally continuous fields of key surface variables. They can do so for extended 
historical periods whilst ensuring a coherent representation of the main Earth system cycles. 
ERA5, 
and its enhanced land surface component ERA5-Land, are widely used in Earth System science 
and 
form the flagship products of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European 
Commission. 
Such land surface modelling frameworks generally rely on a state variable called leaf 
area 
index (LAI), representing the amount of leaves in a grid cell at a given time, to quantify 
the 
fluxes of carbon, water and energy between the vegetation and the atmosphere. However, the 
LAI 
within the modelling framework behind ERA5 and ERA5-Land is prescribed as a climatological 
seasonal 
cycle, neglecting any inter-annual variability and the potential consequences that this 
uncoupling 
between vegetation and atmosphere may have on the surface energy balance and the 
climate. 
To evaluate the impact of this mismatch in LAI, we analyse the corresponding effect it has on 
land surface temperature (LST) by comparing what is simulated to satellite observations. We 
characterise 
a hysteretic behaviour between LST biases and LAI biases that evolves differently along 
the year depending on the background climate. We further analyse their repercussion on the 
reconstructed 
climate during the more extreme conditions in terms of LAI deviations, with a specific 
focus on the 2003, 2010 and 2018 heatwaves in Europe where LST mismatches are exacerbated. We 
anticipate 
that our results will assist users of ERA5 and ERA5-Land data to understand where and 
when 
the larger discrepancies can be expected, but also guide developers towards improving the 
modelling 
framework. Finally, this study could provide a blueprint for a wider benchmarking 
framework 
for land surface model evaluation that exploits the capacity of LST to integrate the effects 
of both radiative and non-radiative processes affecting the surface energy.

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]


The state of the land surface modulates the exchange of water and energy
between the land and the atmosphere~\citep{Seneviratne_2010}. It can thus
affect the physical state of the atmosphere and therefore influence the
seasonal to inter-seasonal predictability and climate
projections~\citep{Koster_2004}.~The biophysical land-atmosphere
interactions are determined by land surface properties, such as albedo,
emissivity, surface roughness and evaporation~\citep{anderson2012climate}, all of
which can be highly heterogeneous in both space and
time~\citep{santanello2018land}. As a result, the partition of~available energy
into latent and sensible heat fluxes can be highly variable over emerged
surfaces of the planet~\citep{dickinson1995land}. The result of this allocation
has a direct impact on local surface or near-surface air
temperature~\citep{pielke2002influence}, which in turn can exacerbate the impacts
of anthropogenic climate change.~

The type and density of vegetation covering the land surface have a
strong role in determining the surface energy balance. Land cover is
normally classified into broad groups summarising land surface
properties involved in land-climate interactions. Under similar
conditions of radiation, a forest will generally absorb more energy than
low vegetation (i.e. grasses or crops) due to its darker surface but, in
terms of surface temperature, this is generally more than compensated by
the larger amount of energy released back to the atmosphere through
higher transpiration, which itself is possible due to improved access to
water through deeper roots~\citep{Bonan2008}. Differences in land cover
have been shown to affect land surface temperature
(LST)~\citep{Duveiller_2018, Alkama2016, Li2015} and even affect the cloud regime above
them~\citep{Duveiller_2021, Xu2022}. However, land surface characteristics also vary
at different time-scales within similar land cover classes and are
further affected by both natural processes and land
management~\citep{anderson2011biophysical}.~Particularly in extra-tropical regions,
land characteristics exhibit strong seasonal patterns due to the cycle
of leaf development and senescence, influencing the seasonality of
albedo, surface roughness length and fluxes of water
and energy~\citep{RICHARDSON2013156}. Another way to characterise the overall
state of the vegetated land that more readily catches such differences
in a spatially continuous way is to consider the state variable known as
Leaf Area Index (LAI).

LAI is defined as half of the total green leaf area
per unit horizontal ground surface area~\citep{yan2019review}. The reason for only considering 
half of the total area in this definition (rather than simply the one-sided leaf area) is to ensure 
non-flat leaves to be considered according to the actual surface area, which is proportional to their capacity to exchange water and carbon.
LAI's importance is indeed that it can represent the exchange surface between plants and the atmosphere, at 
the intersection between water, energy and carbon cycles, thus playing a critical role in the 
feedback of vegetation to the climate system~\citep{fang2019overview, Forzieri_2017}. 
LAI exhibits a large seasonal variability accordingly to climate zones and vegetation types and a substantial 
inter-annual variability linked to year-to-year variability
in weather or in management~\citep{boussetta2015assimilation}. To a large extent,
LAI drives the temporal changes in biophysical properties within a given
land cover type, since some properties, such as albedo and stomatal
conductance, can still differ among vegetation types for the same value
of LAI due for instance to morphological differences in leaf types (e.g.
broadleaf versus needleleaf). In any case, in any effort to estimate or
monitor land-atmosphere interactions and their consequences, getting the
quantities of leaves right seems to be an important consideration for
climate reconstruction and prediction.~

The impacts of land-atmosphere interactions on local temperature are
exacerbated during extreme events such as
heatwaves~\citep{jia2019land}.~The trigger of such events is often an
atmospheric circulation anomaly governed by persistent
anticyclones~\citep{schubert2014northern, brunner2018}, enabling cloud-free conditions and an 
increase 
of net solar radiation.~ Heatwaves can be locally intensified
by land-atmosphere feedbacks, which in turn may result in enhanced
growth of the atmospheric boundary layer that increases the entrainment
of heat~\citep{Miralles_2011} and/or horizontal heat
advection~\citep{schumacher2019amplification}. In addition, a deficit in the soil
moisture content can further warm the air~\citep{hauser2016role}~ so that
both thermodynamic and dynamic drivers could act
synergically~\citep{coumou2018influence}, leading to an amplification of major
heatwaves~\citep{horton2016review}. As a result, heatwaves often occur
as compound events characterised by a persistent drought that increases
the intensity of the heatwave~\citep[e.g.][]{miralles2012soil,Seneviratne_2010}. Studies
suggest that dense vegetation can limit the amplitude of heat
extremes~\citep{renaud2009comparison}, with deciduous and mixed forests having a
stronger cooling effect~compared to conifer forests. Understanding the
role of vegetation states on these phenomena is becoming increasingly
relevant as heatwaves~have increased in intensity, frequency and
duration~\citep{perkins2020increasing}, with these trends getting worse as the
climate warms up~\citep{christidis2015,coumou2018influence}~due to various factors such as the
increased climate variability~\citep{schar2004role}, a weakening of soil
moisture constraints~\citep{Rasmijn_2018} and reduced plant transpiration
due to CO\textsubscript{2} physiological forcing~\citep{skinner2018amplificationa}.~In
addition, observation data reveal a stronger increase of high
temperatures over land compared to trends in global mean temperature,
and this is particularly true for the most~extreme
events~\citep{seneviratne2014no}. The relevance and impact of land atmosphere
interactions is also likely to extend to more northern regions, as
demonstrated in a recent study on heatwaves over northern
Europe~\citep{Dirmeyer_2021}.

To monitor the changing state of the Earth System, including heatwaves,
it is essential to have reliable data that is spatially and temporally
consistent and modelling frames that mechanistically represent the
interplay between the key variables. Although the availability of Earth
Observation (EO) data has been increasing in terms of quality, quantity
and diversity, they remain constrained by two main issues: (1) EO
records can have spatio-temporal gaps and (2) several state variables
can simply not be measured directly. These shortcomings can be
compensated by integrating observations within a modelling framework,
which is where {reanalysis }comes into play.~ By optimally combining
observations and models through data assimilation techniques, reanalyses
can provide spatio-temporally continuous fields of variables for an
extended historical period while ensuring the integrity and coherence in
the representation of the main Earth system cycles~\citep{Hersbach_2020, Dee_2011}.

One of the most widely-used reanalysis for Earth System Science is the
atmospherical reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Currently, the latest installment of this
dataset is the fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis
called~ERA5~\citep{Hersbach_2020}, and it is produced using 4D-Var
data~assimilation and~a ECMWF~model forecast~(the Integrated Forecast
System (IFS))~version corresponding to the ECMWF cycle cy41r2. Within
the IFS, an atmospheric model is coupled both to an ocean model and to a
land-surface model, the latter being responsible for correctly
representing the land-atmosphere interactions introduced above. This
model was originally called TESSEL, for Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface
Exchanges over Land. It was revised to address shortcomings of the land
surface scheme to represent the hydrology to become
HTESSEL~\citep{Balsamo_2009}. An additional land surface CO2 exchange
module was added to enable environmental forecasting applications which
also involves interaction with atmospheric CO2 concentration, leading to
CHTESSEL~\citep{Boussetta_2013}. The land surface model has more recently
evolved into ECLand, a modular system that should facilitate modular
extensions for the benefit of efficient developments and external
collaborations~\citep{Boussetta_2021}.

ERA5 is now a flagship product of the European Commission's Copernicus
Climate Change Service (C3S)~{and is widely used across diverse fields}.
Within C3S, ECMWF has also produced an enhanced land component of
ERA5, known as ERA5-Land~\citep{Munoz_Sabater_2021}.~It is produced by
re-running the land component of the ERA5 reanalysis at a finer spatial
resolution driven by the original atmospheric forcing from ERA5. This
results in land variables at a higher horizontal resolution
(\(\approx\)~9~km) than those available from ERA5
(\(\approx\)~31~km).~ It is also cost-effective way to produce
very consistent land variables over several decades, as observations are
not directly assimilated and the land component is not coupled to the
atmospheric or ocean model. The fact that both ERA5 and ERA5-Land are
now an integral and operational part of C3S means that their production
is guaranteed with timely updates.~Furthermore, following the efforts of
the CO2 Human Emissions (CHE) project~\citep{Balsamo_2021}, ECLand should
become the engine of the prototype Copernicus CO2 monitoring tool within
the follow-up CoCO2 project (\url{https://coco2-project.eu/}). Given its
prominent role in all these initiatives,~there is a high interest in
further evaluation the capacity of ECLand within the ERA5 and ERA5-Land
framework to correctly represent land-atmosphere interactions, in
particular under the extreme conditions of heatwaves.

{In order to correctly characterise land-atmosphere interactions, a
variable that a modelling system should ideally predict accurately is
LST, as it governs the interface between water and energy
fluxes.~}Several studies have revealed how the land model behind ERA5
and ERA5-Land suffers from a strong bias~in its representation of
LST~\citep{Johannsen_2019,Nogueira_2020,Orth_2017}. They all conclude that incorrect 
descriptions
of 
the vegetation are largely responsible for such poor model
performances.~\citet{Orth_2017} demonstrated that there is no region
across Europe or Africa where both mean LST or its seasonal dynamics are
well captured by the CHTESSEL model, but they also suggest that
considerable improvement can be gained by calibrating with multiple
observation-driven datasets. Focussing on the Iberian
Peninsula,~\citet{Johannsen_2019} found that replacing the land cover
representation with a newer ESA-CCI map could reduce the summer
bias.~\citet{Nogueira_2020} confirmed that this LST bias problem with
CHTESSEL was also present in the widely used ERA5 data. They further
showed how another land surface model (SURFEX-ISBA) did not display the
cold bias over Iberia and attributed this improvement to both a better
land cover description and a more appropriate seasonal evolution of
LAI, including a clumping parametrization for low vegetation. Based on
these results,~\citet{Nogueira_2021} updated both land cover and
vegetation seasonality in the ECMWF coupled system to show the potential
of reducing the LST bias beyond Iberia. This work however highlights
the complex regional heterogeneity in the atmospheric sensitivity to
land cover and vegetation changes, calling for re-calibration of the
model parameters and re-evaluation of model assumptions for future
reanalyses.

Although the misrepresentation of vegetation types has clearly been
identified as a main culprit in the shortcomings of LST representation
in ERA5 and ERA5-Land, there is still a main issue that has yet to be
investigated: LAI dynamics. In both ERA5 and ERA5-Land, LAI is always
prescribed at grid cell level with an identical seasonal cycle based on
satellite-derived LAI~\citep{Boussetta_2012}. While this had been
considered as an improvement compared to a more basic look-up table
approach employed in the past~\citep{Boussetta_2012}, it still neglects any
inter-annual variability in the phenology and density of vegetation.
This means that any year where a variation is observed from this
climatological seasonal cycle, in terms of either phase or amplitude,
will lead to a discrepancy between reality and the land representation
in the modelling framework. Such mismatch may be particularly
exacerbated in situations of heatwaves, as plant phenology has been
shown to vary substantially under dry/hot extremes and have important
impacts on the development of these events~\citep{stefanon2012effects, 
skinner2018amplificationa, 
Lorenz_2013}. The benchmarking exercises mentioned 
before~\citep{Johannsen_2019,Nogueira_2020,Nogueira_2021} 
only considered changes in the sources of the LAI products, but always kept
it as a prescribed seasonal cycle, leaving no room to explore the
dynamical nature of the LST bias with respect to the LAI
mismatch.

In this paper, we propose an alternative take on evaluating the
importance of LAI variations on the LST biases within the modelling
framework that produces the ERA5 and ERA5-Land datasets.~We focus
specifically on the dynamic nature of these biases and their possible
repercussion on the accuracy in the reconstruction of heatwaves. The
objective of this work is two-fold: (1) to make a comprehensive
diagnostic of how the combined biases in LAI and LST evolve in space and
time and across climate zones; (2) to evaluate the repercussion this has
on our capacity to represent heatwaves over Europe and set the basis for
a future improvement of the system.


\section{Material and methods}


\subsection{Reanalysis data}

The main data~used~in this study is the reanalysis data. All of it is
available from the Copernicus Data Store (CDS) of the C3S service
(\url{https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/}). The priority is to
investigate the data in ERA5-Land, as users interested in land and
land-atmosphere interactions would probably opt for the dedicated land
product at the finer spatial resolution of 0.1\selectlanguage{ngerman}\textbf{°} rather than
ERA5. Besides, ERA5-Land~shows very good consistency~in the longer time
records, whereas ERA5 surface variables with long memory present
frequent inconsistencies~\citep{Munoz_Sabater_2021}. However, some variables
needed for the study are only available in ERA5. Therefore, the entire
study is focused on the 0.25\textbf{°} grid of ERA5, and all variables
used, whether from ERA5-Land or from satellite products, are aggregated
back to the 0.25\textbf{°} grid. To avoid any confusion and to remind
the reader that the underlying data is mostly pertinent to ERA5-Land, we
will henceforth use the acronym ERA5L to refer to the dataset prepared
in this study, while reserving ERA5 and ERA5-Land to design the original
data sources. The time period considered for ERA5L ranges from~{2003
until 2018}.

Each variable from reanalysis needs to be matched with a respective
equivalent from satellite-derived products that serves as an
`observational' reference.~ For most of these variables, there are
generally various different sources of satellite products to choose
from. The choices we made were guided by the aim to use products that
are independent from the ERA5, ERA5-Land and C3S environments. For each
variable, the match between the satellite reference and the reanalysis
variables requires some specific considerations, and these will be
discussed on a per-variable basis in the following subsections.


\subsection{Leaf Area Index}

The satellite-derived LAI product that we use in this study is
GEOV2/AVHRR (Verger et al. 2021), which is available at~\url{https://www.theia-land.fr/en/product/series-of-vegetation-variables-avhrr/}. This product is based on applying a
neural network retrieval algorithm on the AVHRR Long Term Data Record
(LTDR, version 4, available
at~\url{https://ltdr.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/ltdr/ltdrPage.cgi}).
Additionally, this product benefits from a thorough pre-retrieval
spectral harmonization and a post-retrieval gap-filling procedure. This
product was designed to have a high consistency with the GEOV2-CGLS
products derived from VEGETATION and PROBA-V sensors, distributed by
the~Copernicus~Global Land Service (CGLS), and which have been found to
improve the LST bias in previous studies~\citep{Nogueira_2020,Nogueira_2021}.~The
original product is provided at 0.05\textbf{°} spatial resolution with a
10-daily timestep, and it is aggregated to monthly values at
0.25\textbf{°~}to match the ERA5L LAI.~{From the reanalysis side, the
prescribed LAI is obtained from the ERA5 monthly averaged data on single
levels.} It is obtained by combining the variables called~\emph{{Leaf}
area index, high vegetation} and~\emph{Leaf area index, low vegetation}
on a per-grid cell basis using the fractions of high and low vegetation
prescribed in the model, known respectively as~\emph{High vegetation
cover} and~\emph{Low vegetation cover}.~


\subsection{Land surface temperature}

The observational reference for LST is obtained from the Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on-board of the
Aqua satellite platform. MODIS-Aqua was selected as its overpass time is
approximately 13:30 local time, which would be close to the time of the
daily maximum temperature. The precise MODIS data product is labeled as
MYD11A1 collection 6~\citep{Wan_2015}, based on a split-window
algorithm, and provides data at 1km spatial resolution at a daily
frequency. The variable in ERA5-Land that we compare LST to is called
"\emph{skin temperature}" and is defined as the theoretical temperature
that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance. We select skin
temperature at 14:00 so as to match as close as possible the overpass
time of the MODIS-Aqua instrument.~

To match the reanalysis variable with remote sensing observations,
special care is needed to address the clear-sky bias. The type of
thermal satellite data that we use can only provide an information on
the temperature's surface in the absence of clouds, which typically
leads to sampling the warmer days benefiting from unobstructed solar
radiation. The reanalysis dataset contains values for both sunny and
overcasts days, when the skin temperature is closer to air temperature.
To ensure comparability and have information at monthly scale, only the
5 warmest days of each month are selected from both the MYD11A1 and the
ERA5-Land datasets.~ To facilitate processing for the satellite data,
this procedure is directly implemented in the Google Earth Engine (GEE)
platform~\citep{Gorelick_2017}, which hosts a copy of the MYD11A1
catalogue. The aggregation to the 0.25\textbf{°} grid is done in a
second step. As a consequence of this matching procedure, the LST bias
is always referring to a bias in the five warmest{ days of the month}.~
This assumes that the five warmest days are clear sky, but this
assumption should generally hold as we are using LST at around 14:00,
which is a variable that is highly sensitive to radiation.


\subsection{Albedo}

While the focus of this work is on the relationship between the LAI and
LST biases, it is also useful to investigate how biases in relevant
biophysical variables could help the mechanistic interpretation of the
discrepancies between LAI and LST in the modelling framework. The first
of these variables is albedo, the proportion of the incident solar
radiation that is reflected by the surface. It can serve as an indicator
of whether the LST bias in ERA5L is caused by the radiative effect of
changes in LAI, as an increase in LAI reduces albedo, which in turn
increases net radiation leading to a radiative warming of the surface.

The variable we use in ERA5 is "\emph{UV visible albedo for diffuse radiation}", which is the 
fraction 
of diffuse solar (shortwave) radiation with wavelengths between 0.3 and 0.7 
\selectlanguage{greek}µ\selectlanguage{english}m 
reflected by snow-free land surfaces. Like LAI, albedo in 
ERA5 
is not dynamic, but consists instead of a static seasonal climatology. From the 
satellite-based 
perspective, 
we use the standard MODIS daily albedo product, MCD43C3 V006~\citep{Schaaf_2015}. From this
dataset, we use the broadband white-sky estimations for the visible part
of the spectrum, defined for this product as ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 
\selectlanguage{greek}µ\selectlanguage{english}m. 
This means some slight discrepancy with ERA5 might occur for
ultraviolet light over the 0.3 to 0.4 \selectlanguage{greek}µ\selectlanguage{english}m range, 
but 
this is expected to be very marginal due to the low contribution of UV light to ecosystem
scale albedo. There is a second discrepancy with ERA5 in that this MODIS albedo product is not 
snow-free, 
but this should not be a problem as albedo is only used here in the context of 
studying 
summer heatwaves were only minimal snow cover is expected over the mountain ranges.


\subsection{Land evaporation}


The second associated variable is land evaporation. This is the amount
of water that is evaporated from the land surface, including the
transpiration from vegetation,~ and which is transformed into water
vapour in the air above. In ERA5-Land, the variable is called
"\emph{Total evaporation}"~ and is provided as meters of water
equivalent at a monthly basis. Evaporation or transpiration cannot be
directly measured from satellite observations, but a data-driven
estimation can be obtained from dedicated modelling frameworks. The one
we use here is the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM)
product~\citep{Martens_2017,Miralles_2011}.~ The GLEAM model estimates land evaporation
and its components: transpiration, bare-soil evaporation, interception
loss, open-water evaporation and sublimation. The version used here is
version 3.3b, which does not rely on ERA5 reanalysis data in order to
avoid any circularity in our benchmarking work. Similarly, while GLEAM uses various remote sensing products as inputs, LST is not one of them~\citep{Martens_2017} thereby ensuring it can be confronted against MODIS LST without fearing circularity.


\subsection{Climate zones}

As land-atmosphere interactions are often related to the background
climate regime, it is often useful to stratify their analysis along with
some kind of climate zonation. Here we employ two different climate
classification approaches. The first consists in using the well-defined
K\selectlanguage{ngerman}öppen-Geiger classification scheme, as implemented for the period
1986-2010 by~\citep{Kottek_2006}.~The scheme defines five broad groups:
equatorial, arid, temperate, continental and polar, as well as subgroups
depending on the seasonal rainfall and temperature. The maps are
aggregated from their native spatial resolution of 1 km to the
0.25\textbf{°} grid using the nearest neighbour interpolation. To have
a finer division of climate along continuous axes of temperature and
aridity, a second climate zonation is done based on a division of the
world using intervals of yearly-averaged 2m air temperature and
yearly-averaged soil moisture. For this general purpose of climate
characterisation, these variables are collected from the monthly
ERA5-Land single layer dataset.~


\subsection{Heatwaves}

To isolate the specific effect of the interplay between the LAI and LST
biases during extreme events, this study also looks at three major
summer European heatwaves that have occurred in the recent past. All
three are characterised by a long duration and large-scale extent, but
varied in terms of geographic distribution and biomes affected. The
first is the heatwave of summer 2003 that hit western Europe, and
particularly France, and which will be here referred to as HW03. The
second is the Russian heatwave of July 2010, referred to henceforth as
HW10. The third heatwave considered occurred in 2018 and can be divided
into two zones where the effects had marked differences notably due to
contrasting land cover and background climate. The first zone we
consider is labelled HW18a and covers Northern Germany and Denmark, a
region dominated by croplands, while the second is located mostly over
forests in Finland and is labelled HW18b. The spatial extents of the
zones considered are represented in
Fig.~{\ref{946697}}, overlaid over the LST anomalies
from the period 2003-2018 for the~respective months considered for each
event. On this point, we underline the fact that the characterisation of
the heatwaves is done based on monthly data to remain consistent with
the rest of the analyses, despite the fact that heatwaves would be more
precisely defined by considering their duration more precisely at a
daily scale.

\section{Results}


The outcomes of this study are all based on the analysis of biases
between ERA5L and other observational datasets for the specific
variables of LAI and LST. The results are structured along the two main
objectives mentioned before. The first part thus characterises the
general behaviour of how these biases interact based on their
climatologies, here considered as their mean cycles over the period
2003-2018. The second part then takes a more specific look on how these
biases interact during years that are different from this inter-annual
mean cycle, and more particularly on how this affects years of
heatwaves.

\subsection*{Part 1: Characterisation of the patterns based on the
climatology}

{\label{835449}}

To begin, we first start with a general overview of how the biases in
LAI and LST are structured in space and time. The maps in
Fig.~{\ref{220254}} are composite images where winter
is represented by values for January in the Northern Hemisphere and
values for July in the Southern Hemisphere, while the reverse is true
for summer.~ The LAI in ERA5L is almost systematically higher than the
reference GEOV2-AVHRR LAI during winter, and this corresponds to an
overestimation of LST by ERA5L in the northern latitudes.~ This
relationship between the bias in LST and the bias in LAI is consistent
for such energy limited situation where biophysical effects of
vegetation on climate are dominated by radiative effects. In fact, the
modelling framework assumes there is an excess of leaves covering the
background, the former being generally darker than the latter
(especially when the background is covered with snow) resulting in more
heat accumulation than what would be observed in a situation with fewer
leaves. Since the winter evapotranspiration is strongly limited by the
atmospheric evaporative demand at such high latitudes,~{there is no
compensation of the enhanced radiative warming from evaporative
cooling~\citep{bright2017local}. On the other hand, there is a considerable
underestimation of the LST for many drier parts of the world where
winter evapotranspiration is not energy-limited. This pattern can be
explained by the additional evaporative cooling generated by the excess
LAI in these climate conditions.~The situation is summertime is more
complex, as LAI can either~be overestimated or underestimated~ depending
on the geographical location. The biases in LST generally consist of an
underestimation in ERA5L with respect to the satellite reference, which
is particularly strong in deserts and drylands. There is a notable
exception in Central and Western Africa where the LST is rather
overestimated in ERA5L. The interpretation of how both LAI and LST
biases are related is not straightforward due to the dynamic nature of
this relationship along the growing season and between climate regions.~

To better diagnose the relationship between the bias in LST and the bias
in LAI, we plot them once against the other to analyse their cyclic
seasonal patterns as shown in Fig~{\ref{842529}}. These
plots summarise the bias for all areas under a specific climatic regime
defined by a range in a yearly average of soil moisture and 2m air
temperature. Fig~{\ref{842529}}a represents a region in
a tropical semi-humid climate,~ while
Fig~{\ref{842529}}b is a colder and more humid climate.
In both plots, a typical hysteretic pattern emerges, indicating how the
relationship between the biases is depending on the background climate
and changes during the course of the year. For the tropical region
(Fig~{\ref{842529}}a), the relationship is consistent
with a land biophysical signal dominated by evaporative cooling: an
overestimation in LAI is associated with an underestimation in LST,
which is more pronounced in the months of January to May, while during
the year we observe a loop with smaller biases in summer than in fall.
For the second region (Fig~{\ref{842529}}b), the
growing season follows a stronger hysteretic pattern that even leads to
an underestimation of LAI by ERA5L (as had been observed in
Fig.~{\ref{220254}}), but there is a stark difference
in pattern for the wintertime where a strong change in LST bias occurs
independently of the bias in LAI. This pattern is consistent with the
explanation provided before in which a winter overestimation of LAI by
ERA5L in cold regions could lead to radiative warming due to the darker
surface of dense vegetation, which is not compensated~by~any additional
evaporative cooling due to the energy limitation of evapotranspiration
in winter conditions.~

Such analysis can further be extended to a full climate space delimited by mean surface soil moisture and mean air temperature. A figure depicting the resulting effects of such gradients on the shapes of the hysteretic curves can be found in the supplementary material for this study. Such figure reveals two general gradients in the
patterns of how the LAI and LST biases behave during the seasonal cycle.
The first gradient shows how the hysteretic behaviour increases for
colder and moister climates, while very dry and hot regions show little
variation in either bias and thereby does~not show any significant
hysteretic patterns. Beyond this first general gradient on the
intensity of hysteresis, there is second gradient showing a notable
difference between cold and dry regions, where the magnitude of the
seasonal variation in LST bias dominates, and warm and humid regions,
where this seasonal variation of the bias is stronger for LAI. 

In order to quantify these two gradients of hyteretic patterns, we propose two indices that respectively generalise these patterns of hysteretic intensity and bias
dominance. {{Hysteretic intensity (}}\emph{{HI}}{)} is simply summarised
by the total area (\emph{A}) formed by the hysteretic loop in a given
climate zone (\emph{i})\emph{~}divided by the area\emph{~}of the largest
loop encountered among all climate spaces:

\(HI\ =\ \frac{A_{i\ }}{\max\left(A\right)}\)

The area is calculated based on the smoothed seasonal cycles, which
themselves were fitted using {3rd order harmonics fits applied
separetely to both variables as a function of time}.~ The area A is
calculated for each climate zone considering all intersecting loops as
generating positive areas, which would not be the standard procedure
from a topological perspective (as intersecting loops would generate
areas with opposite signs).

The second gradient relates to
describing which of the two biases (LAI or LST) dominates in terms of
seasonal amplitude. The index to describe this behaviour follows the
logic of a normalised difference index based on the standardised ranges
of both LAI and LST axes in the smoothed hysteresis curves. The
resulting bias dominance (\emph{BD}) index is expressed as follows:

\(BD\ =\ \frac{\left(\frac{range\left(x\right)}{\sigma_x}\ -\ 
\frac{range\left(y\right)}{\sigma_y}\right)}{\left(\frac{range\left(x\right)}{\sigma_x}\ 
+\ 
\frac{range\left(y\right)}{\sigma_y}\right)}\)

where~\emph{x~}stands 
for the bias in LAI and \emph{y} is the bias in
LST.

{These two indices can be mapped in climate space, but then also back
into geographical space, as shown in~
Fig.~}{\ref{988186}}{.} This provides a valuable
diagnostic that enables spatialisation of the magnitude of the
hysteretic discrepancies between ERA5L and observations in terms of the
interrelationship between their LAI and LST biases. This in turn is
useful both for users of reanalysis data, to know where the LAI/LST land
atmosphere interactions are to be expected to be problematic, and for
model developers, to know where they should prioritise model
improvements.~{{More specifically, when the HI map in
Fig.~}}{\ref{988186}}{ indicates a dark area, one knows
the relationship between biases does not have a strong seasonal
component}, and can instead be considered stable. In some cases, this is
because they resume to a single point (e.g. more desertic areas). In
others, it is because there is a clean quasi-linear relationship between
the LAI and the LST bias (e.g. tropical forests, or the example in
Fig.~{\ref{842529}}a), which could also be empirically
``corrected'' using a linear fit if this was deemed appropriate or
necessary for a user (although this would compromise the physical
integrity of the relationship between the variables in ERA5L).~ Areas
with high HI indicate there is a strong seasonal component in the
mismatch between LAI and LST biases, and this appears to affect areas
with strong seasonality in LAI and LST.

\subsection*{Part 2: interannual variability and
heatwaves}

{\label{296419}}

After characterising the general patterns of the biases based on the
mean inter-annual cycles, or climatologies, we now turn the attention to
extreme situations which deviate from the mean. To begin, we start by
showing how the relationships between LST and LAI biases change from one
year to the next. This {is done via an analysis of} their inter-annual
variability for a specific month and place over the considered period
(from~{2003} to 2018). Fig.~{\ref{891702}} displays the
temporal correlation between the biases for selected months representing
the seasons uniformly across the world (i.e. seasonality of the Northern
and Southern Hemispheres are aligned). The most prominent patterns are
negative correlations in drier areas, especially when there is strong
radiation load in summer. This comforts the previous assessment that an
overestimation of LAI in the modelling framework coincides with an
underestimation of the LST, but further indicates how this effect
changes on a year-to-year basis. In other words, the years when the
seasonally prescribed LAI of ERA5L is further from the reality, e.g. in
years where the LAI peak is lower or shifted due to particular~growing
conditions of that~year, the underestimation of LST can be expected to
be more severe.~

\par\null\selectlanguage{english}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.70\columnwidth]{../../figs/corr_summaries}
\caption{{Inter-annual correlation between the biases in LAI and the biases in LST

with Fig.~{\ref{220254}} these are composite maps for

aligned: winter maps consist of data for January in northern latitudes
and July in southern latitudes, while summer maps combine July values in
the North with January values in the South.~
{\label{891702}}%
}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To better understand how the relationship between LAI and LST reacts
under conditions that deviate from the normal, the next analysis
concentrates on using anomalies of temperature as a grouping variable.
For the scope of this analysis, the focus is placed on Europe and for the month of August.
Fig.~{\ref{560364}} summarises how the LAI and LST
biases evolve when considering the full range of temperature anomalies
encountered in our dataset across different climate zones in Europe. To
construct this plot, the entire distribution of values for a given bias
are considered for the month of August. This distribution is
divided in quantiles (deciles in this case) based on their value of land
surface temperature monthly anomalies. For each group of anomalies, the
average bias in LST or LAI is shown. There is a clear difference across
climate zones. For LAI, the bias is relatively stable irrespective of
LST anomalies in subartic climate (Dfc), but it has a tendency to
increase with higher LST anomalies in humid continental climate (Dfb) or
in oceanic climate (Cfb), while in mediterranean climate (Csa) it
actually decreases when extremes occur. LST largely follow the opposite
patterns for the warm extremes, but not necessarily for the cold ones
(most notably in Dfc and Cfb).~ For the specific case of heatwaves,
Fig.~{\ref{560364}} suggests that for most of
continental Europe, the bias in LAI will go from an underestimation in
ERA5L to an overestimation as thermal anomalies increase, and that this
will considerably aggravate the discrepancies in LST.

observations) changes over different climate zones within Europe

}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Finally, we turn out attention to the specific case of the three major
European heatwaves in 2003, 2010 and 2018 with the latter one divided
among the two regions (HW18a and HW18b).
Fig.~{\ref{116908}} maps the differences in the biases
between the year of the heatwave and the average bias for the same
period, and what we refer to here as a bias shift. This bias shift only
informs us on how the bias changes from the normal year to a heatwave
year, but does not indicate whether the~ starting situation is an
overestimation or an underestimation. Therefore, to facilitate the
interpretation,~ Fig.~{\ref{116908}} also includes the
spatially averaged biases for each event under the maps.~

The first point to remark in Fig.~{\ref{116908}} is
that for HW03, HW10 and HW18a~ there is a considerable LAI bias shift in
the same direction due to the fact that LAI is effectively lower in the
observed dataset during these events than in normal years. For HW03 and
HW10, this changes the situation from an underestimation by ERA5L in
normal years to a strong overestimation during heatwave conditions. For
HW18 the situation is different, both with respect to the other
heatwaves, but also among the two sub-regions~considered. For the HW18a
region over Northern Germany and Denmark, the LAI bias shift actually
leads to a situation in which the prescribed LAI in ERA5L is actually
closer to the reduced LAI measured during that specific year, leading
effectively to less underestimation than in normal situations. For the
HW18b region in Finland, which is dominated by forests unlike all other
considered regions, the LAI bias shift is in the opposite direction
going from an overestimation of LAI by ERA5L to a slight underestimation
in the heatwave year.

The second point to highlight in Fig.~{\ref{116908}} is
that all heatwave cases show a negative LST bias shift, albeit with
different orders of magnitude.~ For HW03 and HW10, the LST bias shift is
very strong, and it clearly corresponds to the positive shift in LAI
bias. This confirms that ERA5L can suffer from a cold bias in these
extreme situations, arguably attributable to an excessive evaporative
cooling caused by simulating many more leaves than what is present in
reality. In contrast, the spatially averaged shift in LST bias for HW18b
is almost insignificant, with even some increases in some areas. This is
in line with the remark that LAI over these forested areas may be better
estimated during this event by the ERA5L prescribed climatology,
resulting in very little consequences to the LST bias. In the case of
HW18a over northern Germany, the improvement in LAI for the event almost
entirely removes the positive LST bias that exists in normal conditions.

To better understand how the biases in LST and LAI are effectively
related in the contrasting heatwave circumstances,
Fig.~{\ref{116908}} also provides the same maps for the
shift in two other variables:~ shortwave albedo and total evaporation.
The albedo maps show the shift that would be expected over
cropland-dominated areas during heatwaves, i.e. the senescence of
cereals would be accelerated resulting in brighter surfaces as cereals
dry off, resulting in a negative albedo shift when comparing the real
observed albedo with the prescribed one. This is clearly not visible
over the forested HW18b zone where the LAI bias present in normal years
is somewhat corrected during heatwave years. The evaporation bias shift
shows a different pattern. For HW03 and HW10, the heatwaves aggravate
the overestimation of evaporation, which is coherent with the excess
simulation of leaves in the model and the corresponding non-radiative
cooling that they would cause. The situation in HW18b also shows a
positive shift of the same order of magnitude, but in this case it goes
from a large underestimation of evaporation to a somewhat milder
underestimation, which is consistent with the fact that there is less of
a LAI bias. The likely explanation for this contrasting behaviour may
lie in the strength of the soil-moisture/temperature coupling, which is
high for HW03 and HW10 but less important for HW18b~\citep{liu2020similarities},
and this in turn depends on differences in land cover and background
climate. Croplands and grasslands dominating HW03 and HW10 deplete soil
moisture more readily than forests in HW18b, thereby triggering a more
rapid release of sensible fluxes, while forests can tolerate heatwaves
better thanks to deeper roots and the fact the in these northern
latitudes of HW18b, the soil moisture evaporation that is lower.~

The stark difference is HW18a, which one would assume would behave more
like HW10 and HW03,~ and that the overestimation of leaves by ERA5L
leads to more simulated evaporation which in turn leads to a colder
bias. Instead, the evaporation bias shifts in the other direction, going
from no underestimation~ to a strong underestimation, and yet a cooling
LST bias shift is also observed. This may be linked to uncertainties in
the GLEAM product, which is here considered as the reference
observations. GLEAM does not directly measure evaporation, but rather
infers it from the data based on several modelling assumptions. Compared
to flux tower estimations, GLEAM was also shown to underestimate
transpiration more than ERA5-Land~\citep{Munoz_Sabater_2021}. Therefore, the discrepancy in 
HW18a 
may require more investigation based on other
reference sources.

\section{Discussion}

The present study proposes a novel diagnostic for land surface models
centred around the key variable of LST.~In the particular case of our
evaluation of ERA5L, the analysis reveals the magnitude of the LST bias
and its strong but heterogenous co-variation with spatio-temporal biases
in LAI. It further demonstrates that these have even stronger
consequences for heatwaves, when the bias in LST caused by the
mis-representation of LAI is often exacerbated. The main outcome
therefore is a general warning for users of both ERA5 and ERA5-Land that
the magnitude of heatwaves in particular may be underestimated in these
datasets. A secondary caveat is that these datasets should not be used
to assess the sensitivity of LAI to temperature, nor to other variables
related to the surface energy balance, as there is a clear disconnection
between both.

LST is particularly suited to assess how models represent
land-atmosphere interaction as it summarises an equilibrium point of the
energy balance that can be easily observed from observations. Other
variables of the energy balance, such as the latent heat flux, cannot be
captured so directly by observations, requiring instead several
modelling steps along with their associated assumptions. Large
discrepancies between observed and simulated LST are a strong indicator
that there is a problem regarding how energy is partitioned in the
model, which will further generate uncertainty in the representation of
the atmosphere. In our case, there was a known suspect for the problem:
the mis-representation of the inter-annual variability of LAI phenology
in the ERA5L setup. However, the diagnostic we propose could easily be
generalised to other state variables determining the energy
partitioning. The effect of the static representation of land cover in
ERA5L could be a first example. Although, for the purposes of this
study, we considered that the changes in LAI would implicitly
incorporate changes in land cover, there are further layers of subtlety
to be evaluated. Indeed, the distinction between different classes of
low and high vegetation~can have the same LAI but with different
clumping patterns, resulting in different roughness lengths, which
themselves could have different effects on LST.

Several discussion points can be raised with regards to extending or
improving the present framework for model evaluation. A first aspect
relates to the clear-sky bias in the satellite remote sensing data. Our
approach to focus on the subset of days within the month that have the
highest values in ERA5L should generally be robust to ensure
comparability with the highest values of LST measured by the satellites,
especially during the warmer season when clear skies are directly
associated with higher temperatures. This max LST metric may be less
effective or appropriate in wintertime, as this assumption may not
always hold: clear-sky days may sometimes be colder than overcast days.
Because the measurements are done in the early afternoon when radiation
load is high, it is still reasonable to believe that radiation will be
the main driver determining skin temperature (rather than air
temperature) in many cases, but arguably the assumption may not be as
strong in winter than in summer. A possible improvement could be to work
with daily values and select explicitly days in ERA5L that have
clear-sky conditions. Working at a daily scale would have the added
benefit of being able to isolate the effects of heatwaves more precisely
than with the monthly scale used here.~Replacing MODIS LST observations
with LST from geostationary satellite data, such as SEVERI on-board of
MSG, could even allow pushing further by sampling from different parts
of the diurnal cycle augmenting the chances of clear-sky observations.
However, in all cases there is still the complication that matching
clear-sky observations with the daily (or sub-daily) modelled clear-sky
simulations is hampered by the model's capacity to correctly model
clear-sky conditions, which could arguably be affected by the
misrepresentation of LAI, introducing some kind of circularity.

Another point where the current model diagnostic could be improved
relates to the associated variables used to~help interpret the
mechanistic interpretation of the discrepancies between LAI and LST. In
the present work, we limited ourselves to albedo from MODIS and
evaporation from GLEAM, and only for the heat wave analysis in the
summer. First, their use as explanatory variables could be extended
beyond the summer period. This was currently not done because the values
provided in ERA5L only represent snow-free albedo, which do not reflect
the same reality as the MODIS albedo covering all conditions. Second,
the GLEAM v3.3b used here relies on vegetation optical depth (VOD) to
characterise vegetation growth, a variable that is sensitive to humidity
conditions and which may thus not always be comparable with the LAI
signal estimated from optical instruments. This may partially explain
the inconsistencies in what is happening in HW18a, as the regions of
Northern Germany and Denmark that witnessed that specific event are more
humid in general than the areas in France and Russia where the other
heat waves occurred. Third, other types of such diagnostic variables
could be used. A prime candidate could be soil moisture itself (SM),
estimated from microwave remote sensing. In our case, we declined from
using it because the corresponding C3S project had many spatial gaps
(especially for year 2003) that complicated their interpretation when
comparing it to the other variables.

Despite the strong discrepancies in terms of LAI and LST biases that we
present in this study, it is important to point out that~ERA5-Land and
ERA5 remain invaluable assets for the field. They remain for many the
best tools to describe many meteorological state variables in a
consistent way at hourly scale since the 1950s. We certainly continue to
encourage their use. However, we should stress that the biases we expose
in our results indicate that some diagnostics based on the relationships
between variables in ERA5-Land and ERA5, such as assessing the
sensitivity of LAI to temperature, should probably not be done as it
could lead to wrong assessments.


\conclusions  %% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]

The present work provides a new perspective on the importance for land
surface modelling schemes to capture the dynamical nature of the
interface between vegetation and atmosphere. Basically, getting the
leaves right matter. Biases in LAI, which integrate this relationship
between surface and atmosphere,~are shown to be strongly correlated to
discrepancies in the representation of surface temperature within the
modelling framework behind the highly used ERA5 and ERA5-Land
meteorological reanalysis datasets. The impact of not
simulating~dynamically the LAI cycle is more acutely demonstrated by
focusing the particular case of heat waves in Europe, where we show how
their magnitude in terms of LST may be considerably underestimated. By
characterising and mapping the interplay between these LAI and LST
biases, our work may help users of these reanalysis datasets to
anticipate where and when larger uncertainties could be expected.~ It
should also help model developers to improve their current modelling
setups by establishing a performance benchmark, and by pinpointing where
and when the larger biases occur.~

Overall, ECMWF analyses and reanalyses will continues to pursue the
benefits of coupled data assimilation~\citep{de_Rosnay_2022}, but the
availability of stand-alone land analyses methods~\citep{Fairbairn_2019}
permit to examine the impact of assimilating LAI (and other land climate
data records datasets) to further reduce the LST biases in future
dedicated land reanalyses.~Ultimately, our work does provides a strong
argument to push for the assimilation of land surface variables that can
be measured from satellite Earth observation, such as LAI and LST, in
the weather forecasting system of ECMWF.~Finally, in a more generic
conclusion reaching beyond the ECMWF system, this study could provide a
blueprint for a wider benchmarking framework for land surface model
evaluation that exploits the capacity of LST to integrate effects of
both radiative and non-radiative processes affecting the surface energy
balance.
