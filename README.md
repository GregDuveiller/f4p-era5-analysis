# f4p-era5-analysis

Repository containing the code related to analysing the fitness-for-purpose (F4P) of the ERA5 climate reanalysis to study land-climate interactions. 

All necessary scripts are stored in the `code` folder and relate to data that is structured within a `data` folder. Within this `data` folder there should be one named `input_data` containing source data available from other sources.

The code also uses an ancillary repository to calculate metrics of agreement. This repository is available here:
`https://github.com/GregDuveiller/agreement-index`


## Input data

- `climate_zones` : available at `http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/present.htm`
- `r_data_frames` : available in the JEODPP (calculated by Mark)
